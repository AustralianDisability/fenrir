Known Bugs (Problems with the logic ):
- word echo triggers twice if there are two spaces after an word and you arrow over them
- spellcheck triggers twice if there are two spaces after an word and you arrow over them
- bash prompt is spoken twice as long it screen is not "full" -> Trigger: Vertical Movement, Auto Incomming (one of them needs to be stopped from triggering)
Glitches (improve diff results):
- For example, in screen, it just tells me bell in window, but doesn't tell me which one. (southernprince)
- alpine seems to have problems (southernprince)
- whole status line in irssi is spoken insteed of just the changes
- whole status line in vim is spoken insteed of just the changes

Questions:
- what is the correct codepage for cyrillic
- cyrillic (see autoencoding prototype)
