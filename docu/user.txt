 ====== Fenrir User Manual ======

Fenrir is a modern command line screen reader written in Python3. 
 
It has a modular structure, a flexible based driver model, is highly configurable and easy to customize and extend ([[fenrir_development_manual|see Developer Manual]]).
 
Please see the following pages for the [[fenrir_current_version|current]] and [[fenrir_git_version|Git]] version of Fenrir. 

 
====== Support and Requirements ======
 
Fenrir requires several drivers to interact with the operating system.
 
===== Speech Drivers =====
 
A speech driver is for communication with the text to speech system like [[speech-dispatcher|Speech-dispatcher]] or [[espeak|Espeak]]. \\
See section [[#Speech|Speech]] in ''settings.conf'' for more information.

 
==== SpeechDispatcher ====
 
This driver is used by default.
It uses speech-dispatcher as its backend. 
 
Dependency's:
 
  * speech-dispatcher (installed and configured, [[https://devel.freebsoft.org/speechd#sec2|Documentation]])
  * python-speechd
 
==== Generic ====
 
This invokes speech via a sub-process. This is almost the same as entering the command by commandline. The performance depends on the overhead of the speech syntheses application but it is really flexible.
 
Dependency's:
  * Espeak or Espeak-ng
 
The Requirements are flexible, they depend on the configuration in settings.conf. 
 
==== Dummy ====
 
this is just for debugging, logs are output to the screen and logged as well.

===== Sound Drivers =====
 
To play sound icons and similar.\\
See section [[#Sound|Sound]] in ''settings.conf'' for more information.
 
==== Generic ====
 
This driver is used by default.
 
Dependency's:
 
  * [[sox|Sox]]
The Requirements are flexible, they depend on the configuration in settings.conf. 
 
==== Gstreamer ====

if you prefer to use Gstreamer for sound output.
 
Dependency's:
  * Gstreamer >= 1.x
  * Glibc
 
==== Dummy ====
 
this is just for debugging, logs are output to the screen and logged as well.
 
===== Input Drivers =====
 
Input drivers are to capture the shortcuts issued to the screen reader from the keyboard.\\
See section [[#Keyboard|Keyboard]] in ''settings.conf'' for more information.
 
==== Evdev ====
 
This driver is used by default.
 
Evdev is the low level input device framework for Linux.
 
Dependency's:
 
  * Python-evdev >=0.6.3
  * loaded uinput kernel module
  * exclusive access to the input devices
Read permission to the following files and services:
  * /dev/input
  * /dev/uinput
 
===== Screen Drivers =====
 
The job of a screen driver is to get the information of the current screen.\\
See section [[#Screen|Screen]] in ''settings.conf'' for more information.
 
==== VCSA ====
 
This driver is used by default.
For Linux VCSA devices. These exist on any current standard installation of Linux.
 
Dependency's:
 
  * Python-dbus
Read permission to the following files and services:
  * /sys/devices/virtual/tty/tty0/active
  * /dev/vcsa[1-64] ([[https://linux.die.net/man/4/vcsa|VCSA manpage]])
  * read Systemd DBUS
 
===== Braille Drivers =====
This is for Braille support.
Braille is currently a work in progress and is planned for the Fenrir 2.0 release.\\
See section [[#Braille|Braille]] in ''settings.conf'' for more information.

 
==== BrlTTY ====
 
This driver is used by default.
It uses [[brltty|BrlTTY]] to communicate with with a Braille device.
 
Dependency's:
 
  * BrlTTY (configured and running, [[http://mielke.cc/brltty/doc/Manual-BRLTTY/English/BRLTTY.html|Documentation]])
  * python-brlapi (configured, [[http://mielke.cc/brltty/doc/Manual-BrlAPI/English/BrlAPI.html|Documentation]])
===== Current Platforms =====
 
Currently Fenrir  completely supports the following Platforms:
  * Linux TTY
Support for further Systems are planned.
 
====== Installation ======
 
Fenrir can run without installation. It just requires the dependencies to be installed first.
 
We recommend to try it out before installation to be sure everything works and prevent yourself from experiencing a non-talking environment.
 
===== Try Out =====
Fenrir does not require installation. You can try out if everything works before you want to install. In this way you can be sure that your system doesnt break or does not talking.
for that you can just grab the code and run as root ''src/fenrir/fenrir'' (in foreground) or ''src/fenrir/fenrir-daemon'' (in background, that one is used by systemd for autostart)

===== Install it =====

==== Documented operating systems ==== 
 
==== Arch Linux ====
 
For Arch there are PKGBUILDs in the AUR:
  * [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fenrir/|fenrir]]

==== Manual ====
 
  - Download the latest stable version from the [[https://linux-a11y.org/index.php?page=fenrir-screenreader|Fenrir-Project]] site.
  - Unpack the archive
  - install the needed Dependencys an standard installation requires the following. 
    * python3 >= 3.3 (and all the following is needed for python3 )
    * python3-speechd (screen)
    * python3-dbus (screen)
    * python3-evdev >= 0.6.4(input)
    * python3-daemonize (background service)
    * python3-brlapi (braille)
    * python3-pyenchant (spellchecker)
    * your language for aspell (aspell-<lang>) (spellchecker)

Fenrir provides an clipboard with multible slots, represented by an list. You navigate thought the list and paste the selected clipboard.
== copy marked to clipboard ==
To copy somthing to the clipboard you need to set one or two marks. if you set one mark, the text between the mark and your current cursor is copied to clipboard. Setting two marks just copies the text between the marks into the clipboard. If you copy something it is always placed as first element in your clipboard list.
== clear clipboard ==
You can remove all elements from the current clipboard list by ''clear clipboard'' functionalty.

=== Create Window ===
To create a window you need to do the following:
  - set a beginning mark (as the start of the window)
  - set an end mark (where the window should end)
  - press ''set window application'' shortcut. 
Now Fenrir ignores anything outside of the window.\\
=== Remove Window ===
You can remove the window by pressing ''the clear window application'' shortcut.
Now Fenrir will read everything on the screen again.
==== Tracking Modes ====
Different types of tracking are currently supported
See section [[#Focus|Focus]] in ''settings.conf'' for more information.
=== Cursor Tracking === 
This follows the text cursor. This is the typical way an application works. This is used by:
  * almost any shell such as (Bash, Zsh, sh)
  * vim
  * nano
  * emacs
  * mutt
  * tintin++
=== Highlight Tracking ===
In some applications there are no text cursors. In those applications cursor changes are represented by different colors or attributes (underlined or bold). This mode tracks and announce this changes for you. This is used by: 
    * wifi-menu
    * dialog
    * alpine
==== Tutorial Mode ====
Fenrir provides a Tutorial mode. 
When you enter tutorial mode, sscreen reader commands are intercepted  and explained instead of executing them.

==== Information ====
=== Time ===
Announces the current Time.
=== Date ===
Announces the current Date.
=== Bookmarks ===
Bookmarks provide quick access to part of the screen without the need to navigate to that area.
By default Fenrir provides 10 bookmarks. Those can be set and accessed via shortcut.
This is useful for status lines or other information that the position does not change.
== set Bookmark X ==
You need to set the bookmark first. For that you have to set one or two lines for use.
  - Set marks (one or two)
  - press shortcut for ''set bookmark X''. X represents the number 1 - 10.
== read Bookmark X ==
If a bookmark is set you can access the area just by pressing the ''bookmark X'' shortcut. X represents the number 1 - 10. Bookmarks are dynamic. That means the content changes with the screen. 
== clear Bookmark X ==
to remove a bookmark just press the ''clear bookmark X'' shortcut.  X represents the number 1 - 10.
Afterward the bookmark is no longer available.
=== cursor position ===
You can get information about the current cursor and its position by using the "cursor position" functionality.
=== indent current line ===
Announce the current indention level of the current line. It represents the number of trailing spaces of the line.
=== current screen ===
Reads all the current screen from the beginning to the end.
=== current screen  before cursor ===
Reads current screen from the beginning of the screen to the current cursor position.
=== current screen after cursor ===
Read anything after current cursor postion to the end.
=== cursor read to end of line ===
Read from the current cursor position to the end of the current line.
=== cursor column ===
Read the current X postion of an cursor (column of the current line).
=== cursor line number ===
Read the current Y postion of an cursor (line number).
=== present first line ===
Reads just the first line. this is maybe useful for status information.
=== present last line ===
Presets the last line. This is maybe useful for status information.
=== last incoming ===
Repeat the last automatical inomming text.
===== Input =====
==== Echo ====
Fenrir provides different methods of echoing content:
  * Word: Will speak each word after you push space
  * Character: speak any letter you type on the screen
  * Delete Character: speaks the character prior to the cursor when you push backspace
==== Silence on Key press ====
==== Spellchecker ====
Fenrir has a build-in spellchecker, it can invoke automatically while typing or be called by a shortcut.
Commands to add or remove the current word to the dictionary are included. 
As using the spellchecker is enhanced  usage. You will need dictionary aspell-<language>.
See section [[#General|General]] in ''settings.conf'' for more information.
=== spell check ===
Invokes the spellcheck on the word that contains the Review or text cursor. 
=== add word to spell check ===
Adds the word under the Review or Text cursor to the dictionary.
=== removes word from spell check ===
Removes the word under the Review or Text cursor from the dictionary.
===== Announcements =====
==== Emoticons ====
If you want to replace ":)" emoticons with "smile" in speech you can use this feature.
It can be toggled on or off.
You can define emoticons in an dictionary, please see Emoticon Dictionary.
See section [[#General|General]] in ''settings.conf'' to see how to enable or disable this feature.

==== Time ====
Announce the time in an periodic way. So you can track the time more easy.
You can define 2 different ways of time announcements.
  - periodic
  - on fix minutes

Example periodic, every 20 minutes "delaySec=20":

  [time]
  enabled=True
  presentTime=True
  presentDate=True
  delaySec=20
  onMinutes=
  announce=True
  interrupt=False    

Example on fix minutes in an hour. example every quarter "delaySec=0" and "onMinutes=00,15,30,45":

  [time]
  enabled=True
  presentTime=True
  presentDate=True
  #delaySec is repected bevore onMinutes so it need to be set to 0
  delaySec=0 
  onMinutes=00,15,30,45
  announce=True
  interrupt=False      
==== Promoted List ====
Promoted Lists are a nice feature if you are away from your computer or doing more longer tasks.
you can define a list of words for that you want to hear a sound icon after an period of inactivity.
Example if the word "chrys" appears after 120 Seconds of inactivity:
  [promote]
  enabled=True  
  inactiveTimeoutSec=120
  list=chrys
See section [[#Promote|Promote]] in ''settings.conf'' for more information.
==== Punctuation ====
Fenrir handles punctuation levels and names for you. 
For that job it provides several dicts
See levelDict
See punctuationDict
===== Braille =====
Fenrir provides Braille support in Version >= 2.0.
See section [[#Braille|Braille]] in ''settings.conf'' for more information.
==== braille flush ====
If an message appers on the Braille device you can flush it to got back to the review- or system cursor
==== braille pan left ====
If an line is more longer than your braille device is you can move the view (called panning) to the left.
So you can read stuff without need to move the review- or system cursor.
==== braille pan right ====
If an line is more longer than your braille device is you can move the view (called panning) to the right.
So you can read stuff without need to move the review- or system cursor.
==== braille return to cursor ====
If you finished with reading the line on its braille device using panning, the focus can be returned to the current used cursor by using "return to cursor" command.
===== Dictionary =====
You can make use of different kinds of build-in dictionary's.
A dictionary has a name and list of keys and values separated by :===:
Example:
  [customDict]
  chrys:===:Chrys is cool
  lollipop:===:lolli
that means that every instance "chrys" is displayed, speech will say Chrys is cool.
"lollipop" is spoken as "lolli".
Before making changes to a dictionary we recommend  making a backup of your current dictionary in case future updates overwrite your local changes.
==== Punctuation ====
=== Level ===
The punctuation level dict contains lists with "what punctuation is spoken in what level".
the default one looks like this:
  [levelDict]
  none:===:
  some:===:.-$~+*-/\@
  most:===:.,:-$~+*-/\@!#%^&*()[]}{<>;
  all:===:!"#$%& \'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~
the level "none" has no values. so it should not speak any punctuation (sadly this is not respected by every TTS system)
if "some" is the current level the following are spoken: dot dash dollar tilde plus star slash backslash at.
same for most and all. you can add new levels. if you cycle punctuation levels those are recognized. the default punctuation level is set in settings.conf. default is "some".
=== Punctuation ===
The punctuation dictionary "[punctDict]" contains how the punctuation is spoken. 
Example:
  [punctDict]
  _:===:line  
speaks an _ as "line".  
  [punctDict]
  _:===:underscore
speaks an _ as underscore.
for question mark an ? is appended to the word that the TTS system can announce the question correctly.    
==== Custom ====
The dict "[customDict]" is just for your own use. it does just replace the key by the value without any special functionality. This might be used to correct phonetic wrongly spoken words,make words more common or just shorter. Or even just for fun :).
==== Emoticons ====
The Emoticons dict "[emoticonDict]" contains by default some emoticons. it replaces ":)" by "smile" or "XD" by "loool". So chatting is a little more colorful.
The special on that dict is that you can toggle the substitution it on or off during run time or in settings.conf. This is useful because while doing programming or other serious work you want here colons and parans not smiles.
====== Configuration ======
===== Prepare =====
===== Settings =====
You can configure Fenrir in the following places (ordered by priority):
  - /etc/fenrir/settings/settings.conf
  - <sourceTree>/config/settings/settings.conf
  - run with hard coded defaults.
==== settings.conf syntax ====
the syntax of the "settings.conf" is really simple and is similar to a "*.ini" file, there are 3 different elements. 
  - Sections
  - Settings
  - Comments

A section can look like this:
  [Section]
A setting looks like this:
  settingName=Value
A comment starts with an #.
  # this is a comment

Example:
  [sound]
  # Turn sound on or off:
  enabled=True
  # Select the driver used to play sounds, choices are genericDriver and gstreamerDriver.
  # Sox is default.
  driver=genericDriver
    

==== Sound ====
The sound is configured in section ''[sound]''. 

Turn sound on or off:
  enabled=True
Values: on=''True'', off=''False''

Select the driver used to play sounds.
The genericDriver using Sox is the default.

  driver=genericDriver

Available Drivers:
  * ''genericDriver'' using the generic driver, for Fenrir <1.5 just use ''generic''
  * ''gstreamerDriver'' using the gstreamer, for Fenrir <1.5 just use ''gstreamer''

This is the pack of sounds used for sound icons.
  theme=default
By default we ship two sound packs.
  - ''default'' opus encoded, for newer sox versions
  - ''default-wav'' wav encoded, just for compatibility
Sound packs are located at /usr/share/sounds/fenrir/

Sound volume controls how loud the sounds for your selected sound pack are.
  volume=1.0
Values: ''0.0'' is quietest, ''1.0'' is loudest.

=== Generic Driver ===
The generic sound driver uses shell commands for play sound and frequencies.

''genericPlayFileCommand'' defines the command that is used to play a sound file.
  genericPlayFileCommand=<your command for playing a file>
''genericFrequencyCommand'' defines the command that is used playing frequencies.
  genericFrequencyCommand=<your command for playing a frequence>
 
The following variable are substituted in ''genericPlayFileCommand'' and ''genericFrequencyCommand'':
  * ''fenrirVolume'' = the current volume setting
  * ''fenrirSoundFile'' = the sound file for an sound icon
  * ''fenrirFrequence'' = the frequency to play
  * ''fenrirDuration'' = the duration of the frequency

Example genericPlayFileCommand (default)
  genericPlayFileCommand=play -q -v fenrirVolume fenrirSoundFile
Example genericFrequencyCommand (default)
  genericFrequencyCommand=play -q -v fenrirVolume -n -c1 synth fenrirDuration sine fenrirFrequence
==== Speech ====
The speech is configured in section ''[speech]''.
Turn speech on or off:
  enabled=True
Values: on=''True'', off=''False''

# Select speech driver, options are speechdDriver (default), genericDriver or espeakDriver:
driver=speechdDriver
#driver=espeakDriver
#driver=genericDriver

Select the driver used to generate speech output.

  driver=speechdDriver

Available Drivers:
  * ''genericDriver'' using the generic driver, for Fenrir <1.5 this is not available
  * ''speechdDriver'' using speech-dispatcher, for Fenrir <1.5 just use ''speechd''
  * ''espeakDriver'' using the espeak directly, for Fenrir <1.5 just use ''espeak''

The rate selects how fast Fenrir will speak. 
  rate=0.65
Values: Range Minimum:''0.0'' is slowest, Maximum:''1.0'' is fastest.

Pitch controls the pitch of the voice.
   pitch=0.5
Values: Range Minimum:''0.0'' is lowest, Maximum:''1.0'' is highest.

A Pitch for capital letters can be set.
  capitalPitch=0.9
Values: Range Minimum:''0.0'' is lowest, Maximum:''1.0'' is highest.

The Volume controls the loudness of the voice.
  volume=1.0
Values: Range Minimum:''0.0'' is quietest, Maximum:''1.0'' is loudest.

Some speech drivers like speechdDriver can support various modules. these can be set here.
  module=espeak
Values: Text, Consult speech-dispatcher's configuration to see what modules are available.

Voice selects the varient you want to use, for example, f5 will use the female voice #5 in Espeak,
or if using the Espeak module in Speech-dispatcher. To find out which voices are available, consult the documentation provided with your selected synthesizer.
  voice=
Values: Text, see your TTS synths documentation what is available.

Select the language you want Fenrir to use.
  language=english-us
Values: Text, see your TTS synths documentation what is available.

Read new text as it occurs
autoReadIncoming=True
Values: on=''True'', off=''False''

=== Generic Driver ===
The generic speech driver uses shell commands for speech synthisus.

''genericSpeechCommand'' defines the command that is executed for creating speech
The following variables are substituted in ''genericSpeechCommand'':
  * ''FenrirText'' = is the text that should be spoken
  * ''fenrirModule'' = may be the speech module like used in speech-dispatcher, not every TTY needs this
  * ''fenrirLanguage'' = the language to speak in
  * ''fenrirVoice'' = is the current voice that should be used
  * ''fenrirVolume'' = is replaced with the current volume
  * ''fenrirPitch'' = is replaced with the current pitch
  * ''fenrirRate'' = is replaced with the current speed (speech rate)

Example genericSpeechCommand (default):
  genericSpeechCommand=espeak -a fenrirVolume -s fenrirRate -p fenrirPitch -v fenrirVoice "fenrirText"

Those are the minimum and maximum values of the TTS system that is used in genericSpeechCommand. They are needed to calculate the abstract range in volume, rate and pitch 0.0 - 1.0.

  FenrirMinVolume=0
  fenrirMaxVolume=200
  fenrirMinPitch=0
  fenrirMaxPitch=99
  fenrirMinRate=80
  fenrirMaxRate=450

The current volume, pitch and rate is calculated like this
value = min + [volume,pitch,rate] * (min - max )

====== Customization ======
===== Scripting =====
Scripts can be in any language, bash, python, sh or others. Place your scripts in the directory /usr/share/fenrir/scripts/ (the path is configurable in settings.conf).
The script key is the applications key. Usually this key can be found on the keyboard located just left of the right most control key.
When you name a script, the key name appears in the script seperated by the sequence __-__. So, for example, if you have a python weather script you want assigned to the script key plus the letter w you would name the script /usr/share/fenrir/scripts/weather__-__key_w.py
Then, to access the script, simply press the script key and the letter w.
Scripts must be executable. So, make sure to chmod 755 your script when you place it in the scripts directory.
===== Commands =====
You can place your own commands in "/usr/share/fenrir/commands" (path is configurable in settings.conf).
Commands are python files with an special scheme. You can assign them to an shortcut using the filename without extension or place them in an hook trigger like OnInput or OnScreenChange. For deeper information see developer guide.
Good Examples: [[https://github.com/chrys87/fenrir/blob/master/src/fenrir/commands/commands/date.py|"date.py"]] (announce the Date), [[https://github.com/chrys87/fenrir/blob/master/src/fenrir/commands/commands/shut_up.py|"shut_up.py"]] (interrupt output)
the basic scheme for an command is the following:

  from core import debug
  
  class command():
      def __init__(self):
          pass
      def initialize(self, environment):
          self.env = environment
      def shutdown(self):
          pass
      def getDescription(self):
          return _('No description found')

  * The class needs to have the name "command".
  * "initialize" is running once while loading the command.
  * "shutdown" is running on unload the command (like quit fenrir)
  * "getDescriptsion" just returns an string. That Sting is used in Tutorial Mode.
  * "run" is executed when the command is invoked. (shortcut is pressed, or trigger is running)
  * setCAllback is currently not used. and has no functionality yet.


====== Trouble Shooting ======
Fenrir does not start
  - Did you installed all dependencys
  - Try master, i changed many things for make it compatible to more systems
Fenrir does not consume the shortcuts
  - make sure you have python3-evdev installed
  - use latest Fenrir version
No Sound:
  - run script to configure pulse for Fenrir ''tools/configure_pulse.sh'' (once as user and once as root, then restart)
  - use ALSA
  - configure pulse systemwide
