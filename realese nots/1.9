Translation:
- German (thanks to schulle4u and Jenny) https://robbinaer.info/index.php?article101/fenrir
Fixes:
- no shell in generic speech Driver
- imporove validity checks for speech driver
- handle thread and process shutdown more gracefully
- cleanup
- a lot more fixes
- better device detection
[X] (not conflict with other applications) find . -iname "*.py" -exec sed 's/from \(core.*\) import/from fenrir-screenreader.\1 import/g' {} \;
